# Nuntius

An open source Pusher server implementation compatible with Pusher client libraries written in Go. This is based 
on [IpÃª](https://github.com/dimiro1/ipe), which is no longer being worked on. I like this project a lot, and
want to build on it over time.

## Features

* Public Channels
* Private Channels
* Presence Channels
* Web Hooks
* Client events
* Complete REST API
* Easy installation
* A single binary without dependencies
* Easy configuration
* Protocol version 7
* Multiple apps in the same instance
* Drop in replacement for pusher server
